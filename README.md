Lisp language has been used in this program which means that this programs needs much recursion method thinking that is a reverse direction of the loop. The scenario is simple: When given a starting city (S) and a destination city (G) and the travel agent must find a means of getting from S to G. At various cities, the travel agent has one or more options for travel: fly, take-train, or take-bus. Time is valuable, and thus a direct flight would be better than a direct train for long distances, and a direct train would be better than taking a bus except for very short distances. Considering the cities and the transportation method, by using the A* algorithm, the travel plan agent needs to find the most convenient one. This project gave me a new understanding about the programing because of the recursion which needs contrarain and abstraction thinking.
